The Public Suffix List
======================

A "public suffix" is one under which Internet users can (or historically could)
directly register names. Some examples of public suffixes are .com, .co.uk and
pvt.k12.ma.us. The Public Suffix List is a list of all known public suffixes.

See https://publicsuffix.org/ and the [Wiki](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki) link above for more information.

**Are you here to add or update something?**

All submissions must conform to the [validation and acceptance factors](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/wiki/Guidelines#validation-and-non-acceptance-factors) and provide sufficient rationale or basically be as complete as possible.
The list is maintained by people volunteering their time.  Iteration back and forth will delay PR review or inclusion.
